# drink-track
> Track liquid intake over the day

## Important note

This is a very early alpha. The code has no tests and has not been tested in any way other than manual testing during development.

## What's this?

`drink-track` is a ReactJS web app which I use to track how much liquid I am drinking over the day. It stores all data in `localStorage` so it can not be used across devices at the moment.

In this early stage it is only used by me to track things and probably not useful for anyone else.

## Can I use this?

Yes, you absolutely can if you find it useful. Clone this repository, run `yarn add` and then `yarn start` to start the dev server. The app is then available on `localhost:3000` and can be used from there.

## Additional information

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
